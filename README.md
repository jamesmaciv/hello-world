# hello-world
getting started with github
This is my very first github experience. I'm excited and also a bit nervous about this little journey I hope to make. I will stay resolute in my learning process and try to gain valuable experience. Maybe one day I'll find a remote job on the moon and live happily eating moon tacos.
